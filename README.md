# English Learning Bot
The Bilingual Bot helps users improve their grammar. It texts a user autogenerated questions and texts them feedback based on their responses to these questions. If you would like to try out the app, you can text "Hello" or "Hi" to (734) 201-0150. (App only works when there is a live connection available)



# Language Corrector Repo
https://github.com/AnnabelleLew/language_corrector
This was the grammar API we utilized in our chat bot to suggest corrections.
